            <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
            <p>I'm a fullstack developer currently residing in Phoenix, AZ. I've been practicing software 
                development since 2017 with a current emphasis on the Angular framework. As a natural problem solver, 
                I have a strong passion for this field and a drive to grow within the developer community.</p>

            <h2>Education...</h2>
            <p>After completing the Web Development and Graphic Design program at South Mountain Community College in 2019, 
                I went on to spend my days and nights deep-diving into this craft. I am currently participating in a 
                mentorship program through Tech One IT developing business solutions for our clients and helping to bring 
                their visions to life.</p>
